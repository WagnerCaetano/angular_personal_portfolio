    My studying about programing started at Cotuca, a technical school in
    Campinas, which I did a 2 year course learning Java, .NET, SQL, Python, and
    little about Arduino, besides other technologies..<br /><br />

    After finishing those 2 years, I tried a couple internship process to enter
    in different companies. Eventually I entered at CI&T as a Intern, from 1200
    participants I was one of the 90 that got in.<br /><br />

    In my first year as a intern I worked in a team for Sulamerica, a client of
    CI&T, where I learned best praticies in software development, Spring Boot,
    Angular, Unit Testing, Component Testing, a couple of terms and knowledge
    about the market in general.<br /><br />

    I worked in a product to schedule pacient appointments with doctors, through
    a App, a infrastrucure of micro services created specific for this flow, and
    also an angular web platform where the doctor’s assistent could chose the
    best time for the pacient and the doctor.<br /><br />

    After almost two years working for Sulamerica, I changed to Itau, one of the
    biggest national bank in Brazil, which is also a client of CI&T, since then
    I’ve been working with GDPR and Client Information in a product for the
    bank.
